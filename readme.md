# Slides from the talk *All Together Now! Flocking, Herding and Collective Behaviour in Nature*

Everywhere we look in nature, things are interacting: from the simplest bacteria to the largest mammals. These interactions can produce behaviours far more complex than these individuals are capable of alone. In physics, systems of particles are generally well-understood â€” we know the rules. In biology, the picture is not so clear. How do animals interact? Do we have anything in common with ants? This talk aims to provide an introduction to some models of emergent behaviour and begin to answer some of these questions.
